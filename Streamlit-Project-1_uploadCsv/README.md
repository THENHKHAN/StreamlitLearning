### About :
In this project,  I have learnt how to use **`Streamlit`** `Python library` for Simple UI as a webservice.
Here we can upload **`CSV`** and query on the data in the CSV. Just like we do query on table using `SQL` query.
```SQL
    SELECT * FROM table_name;
    OR SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10
```
**Remark:** Here table means  `csv file name` <br>
`Source`: The CSV i have provide in this project is taken from
